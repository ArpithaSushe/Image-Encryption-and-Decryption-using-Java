# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-Java
A Java-based application that ensures secure image transmission by implementing image encryption and decryption techniques. The program converts image data into an encrypted format using a custom or standard cryptographic algorithm, which can only be decrypted with a valid key or password.
📌 Features:
Encrypts images at pixel or byte level for confidentiality.
Decrypts and restores the original image with perfect accuracy.
User-friendly interface for image selection and key input.
Supports common formats like .jpg, .png, and .bmp.
🛠 Technologies Used:
Java SE (Swing for GUI or console-based UI)
Java I/O and BufferedImage API
Cryptographic operations (custom logic or Java Cipher class)
🔐 Skills Demonstrated:
Java Programming
File I/O and Image Processing
Basic Cryptography
GUI Development (if using Swing)
💡 Applications:
Secure image sharing over networks
Steganography pre-processing
Privacy protection in multimedia communications
